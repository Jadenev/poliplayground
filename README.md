Quick description 💼:
Our app is a user-friendly next.js application that helps reduce political apathy. We let users interact with real U.S. bills, legal terms, and thoeretical-political concepts. All without judgement or the pressure to choose!

How to run locally👟:
"""
Make sure you have Python and Git installed!

FOR CLIENT:
Make sure you cd into client after cloning the project.
npm install all dependencies into your terminal.
create a .env file (basically a file that holds any private things we normally don't want plastered onto codebase)
put this variable into the env file
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
### if your port from the server is different please change it accordingly
### for example if your server is running on port 5000, you'll get a mismatch error with http://127.0.0.1:8080, it should be http://127.0.0.1:5000 instead.

In the terminal type npm run dev
and you should see the port that the client shell is running on

FOR SERVER:
only thing worth noting here is to
Create another .env file
enter a variable called PORT and enter any localhost port number you want, some preferable ones are 5000, 5001, 8080
